# Warmup.Design

A daily design warmup to help designers get better at design.

# TODO

* Remove autopublish package and get the right things publishing in `server/publications.js`
* Figure out how to use flow router and flow layout (already included) from (this site)[http://massimilianomarini.com/flowrouter-and-flowlayout-101/].
* Get fixtures for prompts working.

# Setup

* If you don't have meteor installed, run `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`
* Clone the repo
* Run `meteor` from the app directory, which will serve the app to http://localhost:3000
* Run `meter mongo` to do database stuff directly
